# Katagoshi
Katagoshi is a simple monitoring tool that makes screenshots of your screen from time to time and saves them in a specified folder.

## Installing Katagoshi
Run

	npm install

to update the dependencies, fill in your credentials in the source code and then run

````
	node index.js
````
to let katagoshi run once.

It doesn't yet run in the background and take regular screenshots, nor does it send them automatically.
We're working on that.
